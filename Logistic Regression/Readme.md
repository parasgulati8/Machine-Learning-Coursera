<h1> Logistic Regression </h1>
<h2> Description </h2>
This project is an implementation of Regularised Logistic Regression that predicts whether a microchip passes the quality assurance test.
<h2> Installation </h2>
Download all the files in the same folder and run the "ex2_reg.m" matlab file. 
<h2> Usage </h2>
The code auto-loads the dataset, gives the regression result for different lamda values and plots the decision boundary. The dataset has three columns, the first two are the test results for some microchips on two diï¬€erent tests (independent variables) and the last column is the final decision (dependent variable). 
The code generates two plots, one displays the data and other displays the decision boundary on the data. 

The plots are displayed below :

You can use the code for any problem which has a dataset with same number of independent and dependent variable as in the dataset 'ex2data2'.

<h2> Credits </h2>
The skeleton code was provided by coursera under the course Machine Learning as an assignment.
